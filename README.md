useragent-conference-parisweb2012
=================================

Talk in French language given at Paris Web 2012 by Rudy Rigot, "Les User Agents, c'est le mal !" (User Agents are evil!), based on impress.js

ABOUT CLEVER AGE
----------------

[Clever Age](http://www.clever-age.com) is the web company i work for, and who happens to trust me enough to have given me the opportunity to start our activity in New York City (EDIT: today, the project have been postponed, and I now work for a world-famous web innovation think-tank called [Zenexity](http://www.zenexity.com)).

It's based in France, although being now represented in Geneva, and thrives to provide large clients with any web help they might need. It'd middle-sized, because growing big means losing control over quality; and it's populated with truly passionated web geeks (and yes, i inclide webdesigners in the word "geeks"!)

Also, its focus towards bringing web quality to major brands drove it to start a "social" training institute, [Clever Institut](http://clever-institut.fr).

ABOUT THESE SLIDES
----------------

These slides were prepared to be given as a conference talk to the French speaking web event [Paris Web](http://paris-web.fr).

The purpose is to get over the fact that User Agent parsing is a bad idea, and rather to try to understand why it is.

For a better understanding of what i'm trying to express here, the video will be available some time soon (it might be already, by the time you read this) on [the talk's webpage](http://www.paris-web.fr/2012/conferences/les-user-agents-cest-le-mal.php).

ABOUT IMPRESS.JS
----------------

This talk was made with [impress.js](http://bartaz.github.com/impress.js/), a really neat tool created by a dude named [Bartek Szopka](https://github.com/bartaz/).
