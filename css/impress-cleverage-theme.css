    So, this CSS is basically forked from the impress-demo.css file which
    in included in the impress.js demo : https://github.com/bartaz/impress.js/
    I adapted it for it to look more like my previous regular slides, just
    like this one: http://www.slideshare.net/rudyrigot/responsive-web-design-but-for-real

    You can probably argue if it is needed here, or not, but for sure it
    doesn't do any harm and gives us a fresh start.

    And as the last thing there is a workaround for quite strange bug.
    It happens a lot in Chrome. I don't remember if I've seen it in Firefox.
    
    Sometimes the element positioned in 3D (especially when it's moved back
    along Z axis) is not clickable, because it falls 'behind' the <body>
    element.
    
    To prevent this, I decided to make <body> non clickable by setting 
    pointer-events property to `none` value.
    Value if this property is inherited, so to make everything else clickable
    I bring it back on the #impress element.
    
    If you want to know more about `pointer-events` here are some docs:
    https://developer.mozilla.org/en/CSS/pointer-events
    
    There is one very important thing to notice about this workaround - it makes
    everything 'unclickable' except what's in #impress element.
    
    So use it wisely ... or don't use at all.
